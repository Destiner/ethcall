# ethcall

> [!WARNING]

Utility library to make calls to Ethereum blockchain.

Uses MakerDAO's [Multicall contracts](https://github.com/makerdao/multicall) to make multiple requests in a single HTTP query. Encodes and decodes data automatically.

Powered by [abi-coder](https://github.com/Destiner/abi-coder) and [ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/).

```
npm install ethcall
```

> This package requires ethers V6. If you use ethers V5, you need to install ethcall V5.

> This package uses [Import Assertions](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-import-attributes#import-attributes), which is supported by Vite 4+, Rollup 3+, and Node 16+.

> This package is a pure ESM package. Follow [this guide](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c) for more info.

## API

- `Contract`
  - `constructor(address, abi)`: creates Contract instance
  - `CALL_FUNC_NAME`: yields a `call` object; usage is similar to `ethers` Contract class
- `Provider`
  - `constructor(chainId, provider, config)`: creates a Provider instance
  - `all(calls)`: executes all calls in a single request
  - `tryAll(calls)`: executes all calls in a single request. Ignores reverted calls and returns `null` value in place of return data (wrapper on top of `tryAggregate` method)
  - `tryEach(calls, canFail)`: executes all calls in a single request. Ignores reverted calls and returns `null` value in place of return data for the calls that are allowed to fail (wrapper on top of `aggregate3` method)
  - `getEthBalance(address)`: returns account ether balance

## Example

> Also see [examples](./examples) for reference.

```js
import { Contract, Provider } from 'ethcall';
import { InfuraProvider } from 'ethers';

import erc20Abi from './abi/erc20.json' assert { type: 'json' };

const infuraKey = 'INSERT_YOUR_KEY_HERE';
const provider = new InfuraProvider('mainnet', infuraKey);

const daiAddress = '0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f';

async function call() {
  const ethcallProvider = new Provider(1, provider);

  const daiContract = new Contract(daiAddress, erc20Abi);

  const uniswapDaiPool = '0x2a1530c4c41db0b0b2bb646cb5eb1a67b7158667';

  const ethBalanceCall = ethcallProvider.getEthBalance(uniswapDaiPool);
  const daiBalanceCall = daiContract.balanceOf(uniswapDaiPool);

  const data = await ethcallProvider.all([ethBalanceCall, daiBalanceCall], {
    blockTag: 'latest',
  });

  const ethBalance = data[0];
  const daiBalance = data[1];

  console.log('eth balance', ethBalance.toString());
  console.log('dai balance', daiBalance.toString());
}

call();
```

## Contributing

All Mulitcall contracts are stored in `src/multicall.ts` file. There are three `getMulticall` methods corresponding to three Multicall versions. To add a new contract, you need to know its version, address, chain id of the underlying chain, and (optionally) block at which the Multicall contract was deployed.

## Deployless Multicall

If you query a chain on which Multicall is not deployed, or if you query a historical block before the deployment of the contract, the deployless version will be used instead. In short, deployless Multicall "emulates" the deployed contract and returns the exact same data. Note that you can't query ETH balance using deployless version.

You can read more about deployless Multicall [here](https://destiner.io/blog/post/deployless-multicall/).
